        <h1>Hello</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the telegraph, a way to communicate using sound</p>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="about">
            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                This is the telegraph. The telegraph is a way for devices
                to communicate using ultrasonic frequencies of the sound
                domain(20154 Hz) to transmit data.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently, the telegraph can transmit binary data, so 
                just a blink on other devices, but in the future the 
                capabilities of the telegraph will expand.
                <br>
                <br>
                I plan to add in the ability for the telegraph to transmit
                text data, encrypted text data, and also HTTP requests.
                <br>
                <br>
                However this is the current working version of the telegraph
                so enjoy!
                <br>

            <h3>Also</h3>
            <p>
               Frankly, the telegraph looks pretty bad right now, so
               please note that this site is in a very early stage of
               developement and will not look like this later on.        
            </p>

        <main>
            <h3>Transmission Log</h3>
            <p>
                This is the live transmission log of the telegraph. The 
                box below will be red by defualt, but it will blink 
                green when a binary 1 is sent over the wire.
                <br>
                <br>
                Also, please note the input box. This box will have the
                number 200 in it by default, but this can be changed.
                The number controls what threshold determins if a signal
                is a one or if it is a zero. So if you want to bias the
                input data, a higher value will favor a zero and a lower
                value will favor a one. This number should be mapped between
                0 and 255.
            </p>
            <input type="text" id="over" value="200">

            <h3>Send A Signal</h3>
            <p>
                Press the button below to send a binary one over the wire.
                You should notice that the surrounding devices running
                telegraph software should blink green in their 
                transmission logs.
